    <h2>WAIT.WHAT?</h2>
    
    <p> I said I wanted simple, but not boring. What is up with this design? <br>
    
        There is nothing on it but white space and a minimal picture. Thats <br>
        not what I had in mind.The type is Helvetica, which I like but <br>
        doesnt excite me at all. There is no character to anything here. <br>
        It has a minimal look, but its just too vanilla. I really need <br>
        something to grab the attention of a visitor on site and this just doesnt do it.  <br>
